    <string name="rules_chess_title">Chess Rules</string>
    <string name="rules_chess"><b>Basic moves</b> \n The <b>king</b> moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game (see below). \n \u2022 A <b>rook</b> moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. It also is moved when castling. \n \u2022 A <b>bishop</b> moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction. \n 􀀀 The queen moves any number of vacant squares in a
        horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction. \n \u2022 A <b>knight</b> moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. The knight is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location. \n \u2022 <b>Pawns have the most complex rules of movement: </b>\n  \u2022 A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is
        vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards. \n \u2022 Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to
        those squares if they are vacant). \n The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion. \n \n <b>Castling</b> \n
        Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook,
        then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to
        it.[2] Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions
        hold: \n \u2022 The king and rook involved in castling must not have
        previously moved; \n \u2022 There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
        \n \u2022 The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass
        through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy
        piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to
        pass over an attacked square);
        \n \u2022 The king and the rook must be on the same rank \n If a white pawn moves forward two squares and Black has a pawn
        on the fourth rank on an adjacent file, Black can capture White's
        pawn as if the white pawn had moved only one square. This
        capture can be made only on the immediately subsequent move.
        In this example, if the white pawn moves a2–a4, the black pawn
        on b4 can capture it en passant, ending up on a3 \n <b>Pawn promotion</b> \n If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then
        promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the
        same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually
        chosen). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces.
        Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine
        queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns
        are promoted. If the desired piece is not available, the player
        should call the arbiter to provide the piece (Schiller 2003:17–
        19). \n <b>Check</b> \n A king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy
        piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king
        in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check
        to the opposing player.
        A player may not make any move which places or leaves his king
        in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:
        \n \u2022 Move the king to a square where it is not threatened.
        \n \u2022 Capture the threatening piece (possibly with the king).
        \n \u2022 Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the
        opponent's threatening piece If it is not possible to get out of
        check, the king is checkmated, and the game is over (see the
        next section). \n In informal games, it is customary to announce "check" when
        making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. However,
        in formal competitions check is rarely announced.</string>
